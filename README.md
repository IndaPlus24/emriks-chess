<h2>Make move function</h2>
I changed so that it doesn't take Strings as parameters but rather Vec with the cordinates in it (x,y).

<h2>Get possible moves function</h2>
I've changed so that it takes &Vec<usize> as param and returns Option<Vec<Vec<usize>>>.

<h2>Y is [0] and X is [1]</h2>
Didn't really intend on doing it like this but when I noticed, it was to late to change it to x,y. So y is first and x second.
